# `04` Validate your work

This step consists of executing a verification script to validate what has been requested in this practice, to do so follow the steps below:

## 1. Run the validation script `validate-update-script.sh`.

Inside the `.learn/assets` directory of this exercise, you will find a bash script `validate-update-script.sh`.  

Run the file:

```sh
bash .learn/assets/validate-update-script.sh
```

If all goes well you will now see a report.json file that contains the data you need to upload as a solution to your project.

## 2. Read the results

Open the `report.json` and read it. Make sure it's not empty and contains some data.

## 3. Upload your results

The report.json file is what you need to upload when delivering this project.
