For this practice, we will continue to work on the Debian virtual machine from previous projects.

This machine comes with Debian installed and it has some basic settings that will be used along the bootcamp. If you don't have it already, click here to access the [Debian virtual machine file and installation instructions](https://4geeks.com/docs/start/cybersecurity-virtual-machines#debian-virtual-machine).

## 🌱 How to start this project.

Clone this repository inside the local Debian virtual machine environment and follow the steps below:

1. Install LearnPack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the node compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 14:

```bash
$ npm i @learnpack/learnpack -g
```

2. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level where your learn.json file is:

```bash
$ learnpack start
```
